# mood-tracking-app

*Currently in development*

See our progress on our kanban board: https://github.com/main-throws-Exception/mood-tracking-app/projects/1

The application allows the user to be more attentive to their mental well-being by documenting and visualizing it.

Several times a day, the application sends a notification with buttons asking you to evaluate your current mental state and creates corresponding entries, which can then be evaluated with any information in the application itself (like adding tags or a note). All this information is stored, systematized, and visualized (for example, the days on the calendar are colored corresponding to the average mood for that day, and charts appear so that the user can track trends and find correlations with external factors).

Also, the user can set a goal of average well-being and strive for it.
